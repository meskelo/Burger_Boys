A website for a local restaurant 
Christopher McDaniel, Luke Noles, and Solomon Smith

“Bell’s Drive In” is a website devoted to serving as an outlet for people to learn about the subsequent restaurant which can be found in its home-base of Henderson, Tn.

For the people of Chester County, the restaurant is very well known and loved. However, Bell’s can reach out to many more people in the region if it were to have its own online site. The site is simple but effective in giving one just the right amount of information and background about the establishment in order to inform and endorse. 

Website:

After less than perfect negotiations with the owners and managers, we took the initiative in promoting the establishment independently at first. In acquiring the required information, we worked with the team at Bell’s getting images, awards, and insight on how extensive their menu options are. In keeping with the old fashioned vined giving by their furniture, decorations, and cash-only policy, we made our 50’s themed with those older, more flavorful color palettes. 

The Site consists of various pages covering all the necessary content for an online restaurant site:
Home Page, Menu Page, an About Page, Location Page, Contact Page, and an Awards Page.

Home:  This page contains or logo, slogan, and an overview of how locals experience the place.

Menu:  It consists of all entrees, drinks, sides, and desserts.

About:  The brief history of the establishment and its effects on the community as a whole can be found here.

Location:  Viewers can be linked to the establishment’s location.

Contact:  Viewers can be linked to our page or directly in touch with use via phone if one views it on a cellular device.

Awards: 
Curious viewers may see some of Bell’s various awards over the years.




Strengths:

As a team, we started our website expecting it to be all fun in games. In the first few days we achieved creating our logo and the backgrounds for our first few pages. At times of difficulties, pulled through with a mixture of outside help, teachers opinions, online assistance, brainstorming, and a little bit of luck. In the end, we created a decent website. Although it may not be ready to see public use, it is an accurately culmination of our teamwork skills and coding abilities. 

Weakness: 

On the other hand, the team several difficulties internally and externally. The group, at different points in the web design process, found it difficult to focus, stay on task, and come to terms with the responsibilities required of them as an individual on the team. As a whole, the group was very disgruntled and uncooperative. However, the team pulled through and united a one to finish out the competition.
